# Simon-Says-No-
"Simon Says No" is a fun and challenging memory-based game with a twist! Unlike the classic Simon Says, here you must remember the sequence and do the opposite. When the game shows a pattern, you must click a different color instead of copying it. It tests your concentration, reflexes, and reverse thinkingâ€”perfect for a quick brain workout!
